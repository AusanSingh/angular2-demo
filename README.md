# Angular2 Demo

A minimal Angular2 demo site using: 

- TypeScript
- SystemJS
- NPM Build
- SASS

The demonstration was a project to learn Angular2 while teaching my [beautiful fianc√©e](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hpiernick) how to code our wedding website; I hope you enjoy!

## Component Tree

## File Structure

The folder structure is aimed to encapsulate components into their own modules. In each component folder, it contains all the html, css, js for that.  Components that are not coupled to this application are grouped into a common folder for reuse.

```
/src
  /app
    /header
    /rsvp
  /common
    /parallax
    /utils
```
